        <h1>Guide to raise your first cats</h1>
    </header>
    <p>1. Consider whether there are physical and environmental conditions for cats.<br><br>
        Expenses: Taking safe commercial cat dry food as the minimum standard, the monthly cost of cat food + cat litter
        + necessary medicines should be about 100~150 yuan. <br><br>Basic environmental assessment for cat raising:
        whether
        there is a cat litter box that can be isolated from food and water sources, preferably from where you sleep. And
        it can meet the space for cats to run and climb. If you don't have such conditions, it may be torture for the
        cat and for you, and it is difficult to last.
        <br><br>
        2. Obtain the consent of those around you who may be affected, such as landlords, roommates, family members,
        etc.
        <br><br>
        3. Small animals need companionship. Although cats are relatively independent, they are prone to depression when
        they are often left alone. Please spend at least half an hour to an hour with it every day as much as possible,
        and give it enough petting and play.
        <br><br>
        4. It is necessary to understand the knowledge of cats in advance. In addition to the most basic food, drink and
        shit, cats will also lose their temper, monthly deworming, annual vaccines, food to eat, things to use, estrus,
        pregnancy, giving birth to babies, etc. Wait for all aspects of knowledge, instead of getting one home on a
        whim.<br><br>
