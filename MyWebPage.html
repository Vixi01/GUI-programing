        <p>1. Consider your economic and environmental conditions for raising a cat.<br><br>

            litter + necessary medicines should be around $53. <br><br>Basic environmental assessment for cat raising:
            A cat litter box that can be isolated from food and water sources and from where you sleep.
            And space that can meet for cats to run and climb. If you don't have such conditions, it may be torture for
            the cat and for you.
            <br><br>
            2. Have permission of those around you who may be affected, such as landlords, roommates, family members,
            etc.

            possible, and give it enough accompany.
            <br><br>
            4. It is necessary to understand cats habit in advance. In addition to the most basic food, drink and poop,
